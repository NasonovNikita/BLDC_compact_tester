## Idea
Sometimes you may not clearly know what are the pins of a BLDC motor used for. It has three phase pins, VCC and GND for Hall pins, the three Hall pins. 8 pins in total to check by hand.
So the purpose of this project is to make the process automized.

## Current goals
- [ ] Decide on working concept and components
- [ ] Make an electrical scheme
- [ ] Trace PCB
- [ ] Write code
- [ ] Testing and debug
- [ ] Modeling case and parts
- [ ] Creating final product
